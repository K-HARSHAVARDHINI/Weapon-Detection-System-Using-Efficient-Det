# Weapon Detection System Using EfficientDet

This project implements a real-time weapon detection system leveraging the EfficientDet and backbone as EfficientNet algorithms. It processes video inputs from live camera feeds or uploaded videos to detect weapons like guns and knives, displaying bounding boxes and confidence scores.

Key Features:
Frame Efficiency: Reduced detection frames from 30â€“50 to just 27, ensuring faster processing.
Real-Time Video Analysis: Supports live and uploaded video detection for instant threat identification.
Alert Generation: Sends email notifications with weapon type, timestamp, and optional screenshots for immediate response.
Adaptive System: Continuously updates with new data to improve detection accuracy.
Technical Stack:
Programming: Python
Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras
Tools: Jupyter Notebook
Deployment and Impact:
The system is scalable for deployment on edge devices, enhancing operational efficiency. It addresses limitations in traditional detection systems, improving public safety and ensuring quicker responses to potential threats.
